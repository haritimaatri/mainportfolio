creating an effective portfolio a basic one using html ,css and javascript .
I created this portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a modern and responsive design. I also experimented with Three.js to integrate 3D models, enhancing the interactive experience. The animated 3D images were sourced from Sketchfab, while the project itself is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy cloning and contributions. ðŸš€

Cloning the repo with all its history results in a ~2 GB download. If you don't need the whole history you can use the depth parameter to significantly reduce download size.
